# FuelRegistry
Fuel Registry is app that utilizes H2 database, Java backend and Angular frontend to capture and show the fuel consumption of my car.

When I bought my parents car, I got database that my father had collected over the years and I decided to continue updating the database, but for me the database format (Microsoft access) was something I was not familiar with.
So I decided to use tools that I know, so I inserted the data to H2 and made backend with Java and trying to build front with Angular as I like it most from frontend techs I know. 

Database is not included.
